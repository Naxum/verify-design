                    Roles: game designer and developer.
                    Team: substantially just myself.
                    Responsibilities: designed and developed a system thatâ€”using existing challenges in Minecraft as a resourceâ€” empowered players to create owned areas that allowed them to play the game however they liked, without the troubles of letting everyone abuse and grief each other.
                    Accomplishments: longest project I've ever worked on, and easily the biggest and most rewarding. Spanning several years through my college experience, had several devoted players and met many friends through the experience. Allowed both peaceful and warring groups of players to exist on the server in harmony.
                    Tools: developed in Java using the Eclipse IDE and Bukkit APIs to create a custom Minecraft server.

                    Tools: web development in Atom, mockup design and tweaking done in Illustrator and Sketch. The website was built on top of Harmony's content management system, and the templates were built from scratch.

                    Accomplishments: learned how to deal with REST-based APIs in Javascript for the first time. Created as my main project during my internship at Adobe.
                    Tools: code written in Adobe Edge Code CC, built on top of Brackets. Used a private Adobe-based API at first, eventually moved onto 500px's API after my time at Adobe. Also experimented with Edge Animate CC and Sketch for an intro animation that was ditched.
