                    Accomplishments: learned how to deal with REST-based APIs in Javascript for the first time. Created as my main project during my internship at Adobe.
                    Tools: code written in Adobe Edge Code CC, built on top of Brackets. Used a private Adobe-based API at first, eventually moved onto 500px's API after my time at Adobe. Also experimented with Edge Animate CC and Sketch for an intro animation that was ditched.

                    Responsibilities: developed a road-based node system that allows cars and people to move around semi-realistically on city streets. Also created basic artificial intelligence system that allows biplanes to circle around the players head and periodically fire at them.
                    Accomplishments: created a game for a system of which we had less than 24 hours of access, within 48 hours for a weekend-long jam.
                    Tools: used Unity as game engine, wrote C# code in Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. Final game was created for the Vive, and was prototyped with an Oculus Rift development kit.
